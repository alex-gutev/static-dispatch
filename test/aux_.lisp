;;;; These tests test the use of STATIC-DISPATCH rather than it's
;;;; internals. Specifically:
;;;;
;;;;  1. That Generic functions are actually statically dispatched
;;;;     when declared INLINE.
;;;;
;;;;  2. That the result of the generic function call is correct
;;;;     regardless of whether they are statically dispatched or not.
;;;;
;;;; This test suite tests auxiliary (:BEFORE, :AFTER and :AROUND)
;;;; methods.
;;;;
;;;; NOTE:
;;;;
;;;;  If a test of the form "F is statically dispatched" fails, this
;;;;  means that STATIC-DISPATCH was unable to choose the appropriate
;;;;  method for F at compile-time, thus will fallback to dynamic
;;;;  dispatch. Programs using STATIC-DISPATCH will still function
;;;;  correctly, provided the remaining tests don't fail, however they
;;;;  will not be able to make use of statically dispatched generic
;;;;  functions on the implementation on which the test fails. In this
;;;;  case generic functions fallback to the standard dynamic
;;;;  dispatch.
;;;;
;;;;  Similarly failures of the form is expected to raise a condition
;;;;  ILLEGAL-CALL-NEXT-METHOD-ERROR/NO-PRIMARY-METHOD-ERROR indicate
;;;;  that the generic functions were not statically dispatched and
;;;;  hence these conditions are not raised but the builtin CLOS
;;;;  conditions are raised.
